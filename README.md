#ESP32 flight controller
I have chosen ESP32 as flight controller mainly bacause of its cost, wifi & BLE capabilities and 80MHz clock speed which is 5 times faster than arduino. 
##Code files

1. Anglemode_flightcontroller_ver3 -  This is the complete code for ESP32 flight controller. Make sure to give inital 10s calibration time for the quadcopter to calibrate Gyro on a spirit level.
2. receiver_pwm_esp32 - This code is independently to test the reciever & trasmitter signals on serial monitor
3.
